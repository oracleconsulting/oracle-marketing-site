# Oracle Marketing Site - Redirects Fix Summary

## 🚨 Problem Identified

You were experiencing 404 errors and login issues because:

1. **Wrong Architecture Understanding**: I initially thought the issue was in the `oracle-method-portal`, but you correctly pointed out that you were in the `oracle-marketing-site` trying to access the roadmap
2. **Static Export Redirect Issue**: Next.js static exports (`output: 'export'`) don't support server-side redirects
3. **Resource Loading Errors**: The marketing site was trying to load resources from itself instead of redirecting to the method portal

## 🏗️ Correct Architecture

```
oracle-marketing-site (Next.js Static Export)
├── Landing pages (/)
├── Marketing content (/pricing, /about, etc.)
└── Redirect pages (/auth, /dashboard, etc.)
    └── Client-side redirect to oracle-method-portal

oracle-method-portal (Vite/React)
├── Authentication (/auth)
├── Dashboards (/dashboard)
└── Accountancy portal (/accountancy/*)

oracle_api_server (Python/FastAPI)
└── Backend APIs
```

## ✅ Solution Implemented

### 1. Fixed Next.js Configuration
- **Removed** server-side `redirects()` function (not supported in static exports)
- **Simplified** image configuration for static export
- **Kept** environment variables pointing to method portal

### 2. Created Client-Side Redirect Pages
- `/auth` → Redirects to `oracle-method-portal-production.up.railway.app/auth`
- `/dashboard` → Redirects to `oracle-method-portal-production.up.railway.app/dashboard`
- `/accountancy/auth` → Redirects to `oracle-method-portal-production.up.railway.app/accountancy/auth`
- `/assessment` → Redirects to `oracle-method-portal-production.up.railway.app/assessment`

### 3. Updated Static Hosting Configuration
- Enhanced `_redirects` file for proper static hosting
- Added SEO redirects for `/home` and `/landing`
- Maintained SPA fallback routing

## 🔧 Files Modified

### Core Configuration
- `next.config.js` - Removed server-side redirects, simplified for static export
