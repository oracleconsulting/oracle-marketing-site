# 🚀 Marketing Site - Ready for Deployment

## ✅ Build Status: SUCCESSFUL

The marketing site has been successfully built with all redirect fixes applied.

## 🔧 What Was Fixed

1. **TypeScript Error**: Removed unused `useRouter` import from `/auth` page
2. **Static Export**: All redirect pages now work with Next.js static export
3. **Client-Side Redirects**: Proper redirects to method portal implemented

## 📊 Build Output

```
Route (app)                              Size     First Load JS
├ ○ /auth                                510 B          87.8 kB
├ ○ /dashboard                           512 B          87.8 kB
├ ○ /accountancy/auth                    520 B          87.8 kB
└ ○ /assessment                          513 B          87.8 kB
```
