      question: "Why only 50 clients?",
      answer: "Because real service takes time. I'd rather do exceptional work for 50 businesses than mediocre work for 500. Every client gets my personal attention, not passed to a junior."
    },
    {
      question: "What makes you different from other accountants?",
      answer: "I've been through 3 PE acquisitions myself. I know the pressure, the negotiations, the sleepless nights. When I say 'we fight', I mean it - I've been in the trenches."
    },
    {
      question: "Do you work with startups or just established businesses?",
      answer: "Both. Whether you're just starting out or preparing for exit, we provide the same personal service. The key is you're serious about building something real."
    },
    {
      question: "What if I already have an accountant?",
      answer: "No problem. We'll handle the transition smoothly. Most clients switch because they're tired of being a number. If you want someone who actually cares about your business, let's talk."
    },
    {
      question: "How do you handle PE negotiations?",
      answer: "With experience and aggression. I've been on both sides of the table. I know their tactics, their pressure points, and how to protect your interests. This isn't theoretical - it's personal."
    },
    {
      question: "What's your pricing structure?",
      answer: "Transparent and fair. No hidden fees, no surprise bills. We'll agree everything upfront. Quality service costs more than a box-ticker, but the value is incomparable."
